### Seminar

You will be assigned to analyze one country from Scandinavia: Sweden, Denmark, Norway, or Finland.

The lecture identifies major puzzles in Scandinavian far-right trajectories (organizational transformation, government participation effects, welfare chauvinism, moderation paradoxes, etc.). Your task is to investigate these puzzles by developing preliminary explanations for your country, which we'll test against other regions in Weeks 5-6.

Using the lecture and assigned readings, explore your country's trajectory to develop three working hypotheses:

On Teams Whiteboard, record your analysis using the following structure:

Record your analysis:

**Country**: [Name]

**Voter hypothesis**: Who voted far-right and why?

**Party strategy**: What made this party succeed or fail?

**Mainstream strategy**: How should mainstream parties have responded?

Present your findings to the seminar (3 minutes). Then consider the broader pattern: *Do all five countries follow the same logic, or do different factors seem to explain different cases?* Record your observations on Whiteboard.


#### What's next

Your hypotheses will be tested against other regions (Weeks 2,3, 5 & 6). As we accumulate evidence, we'll refine and generalize our working theory. In Weeks 7-10, we'll compare your findings to academic theories to see how we should explain Far Right support.

## Whiteboard

*Scandinavia - Seminar Notes:*

### General Themes
*   **Immigration:** Uniting trend across the region.
*   **Voters:** Male-dominated, older (55+), low-mid educational attainment.
*   **Strategy:** Denmark used adoption/accommodation (led to party collapse); Sweden used exclusion (cordon sanitaire).

### Regional Comparison

| Feature | Scandinavia | Western Europe |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Voter Age** | Middle-aged | Older (70+) |
| **Cordon Sanitaire** | Absent (except Sweden) | Prevalent |
| **Breakthrough** | Later (2000s-2010s) | Earlier (1980s-1990s) |
| **Focus** | Welfare Chauvinism | Economic/General Protest |

### Student Group Observations
*   **Group 3:** Irreversibility of engagement; once mainstream parties adopt FR policies, they rarely go back.
*   **Group 4:** Manual routine workers; emphasis on preserving post-materialist Western values in rhetoric vs traditional views in manifestos.
