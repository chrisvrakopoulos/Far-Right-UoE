### Seminar

#### The Grand Synthesis: Reflecting on 10 Weeks of Theory

This week's seminar focuses on connecting the dots across our entire course, from the definitions of Week 1 to the global patterns of Week 10.

**Part 1: The Global Debate (20 mins)**
*   **Discussion:** Is the Far-Right a single global phenomenon, or are we stretching the concept too thin? (Reference: **de Jonge et al. 2024**).
*   **The "Other" Paradox:** How is the "Other" defined in Scandinavia vs. Latin America? What remains consistent (e.g., exclusionary logic)?

**Part 2: The Final Whiteboard (30 mins)**
*   **Reflection:** Look at all the **Whiteboards** we have generated since Week 1. 
*   **The Test:** How did our early hypotheses (Week 1) about why people vote far-right compare to the theories (Weeks 7-9) and evidence (Weeks 2-6, 10)?
*   **The Synthesis:** Based on what we have learned, what is the single most important factor (Demand or Supply) driving the far-right today? 

**Part 3: Assessment Clinic**
*   **Final Essay Q&A:** Bring your essay outlines for a final peer and tutor review.
