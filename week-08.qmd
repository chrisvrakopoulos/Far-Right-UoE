### Seminar

**Objective**: To explain the timing and variation of far-right success by applying the Structure and Agency frameworks to your original regional findings.

#### Seminar Preparation:

Look at the "Party Strategy" and "Mainstream Strategy" columns from your original regional weeks (Weeks 2-6). Why did you think the party succeeded or failed then?

#### In-class activities:

1) Demand vs Supply
Using today’s lecture, classify the countries from your region in the table below. What do you observe? Which is more powerful explanation for cross-national variation?

|             |               |             |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
|             | Closed Supply | Open Supply |
| Low Demand  | Country X1    | Country X2  |
| High Demand | Country X3    | Country X4  |

2) The Meguid Challenge: Mainstream Reactions

Look at your original notes on how mainstream parties responded. Re-evaluate them using Meguid's Theory:

a) Did the mainstream right Dismiss, Accommodate, or be Adversarial? 

b) Did their strategy "kill" the far right (like in Denmark) or "feed" it (like in Italy/Austria)?

3) Solving the "Why Now?" Puzzle

Compare your breakthrough date (e.g., Vox 2018 vs. AfD 2013). 

If the Demand was there for decades (from Week 7), what specifically changed in the Supply that allowed the breakthrough to happen in that specific year? Was it POS or DOS?

4) The Grand Theory Synthesis

On the whiteboard, we will build the final course map.

Region: [e.g., Scandinavia]

Demand Driver: [e.g., Cultural/Welfare]

Supply: [e.g., Welfare Chauvinist Formula + Institutionalisation]

Synthesis: Why is the far right more stable in this region than in the South or East?
