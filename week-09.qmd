### Seminar

#### The Strategy Workshop: Stopping the Far-Right?

**The Scenario:** You are a strategic advisor to a mainstream center-right or center-left party in Europe (e.g., in France, Germany, or Sweden). A far-right party is surging in the polls. 

**Your Task:** In your assigned "Strategy Teams," choose one of the following approaches and present your reasoning:
1.  **Exclusion (Cordon Sanitaire):** Strict isolation. Never vote for their bills; never enter a coalition.
2.  **Co-option (Strategic Mimicry):** Adopting their rhetoric (e.g., on immigration) to "win back" their voters.
3.  **Collaboration (The Responsibility Trap):** Bringing them into government to "tame" them through the reality of governing.

**The Question:** Can normalisation be stopped? Use your knowledge of "Supply" (Week 8) and "Normalization" (Week 9) to justify your chosen strategy. Record your team’s final decision on the **Whiteboard**.
