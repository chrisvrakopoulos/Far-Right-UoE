# Part 1: The Puzzle

## Demand Without Breakthrough (1968–2010)

::::::::::::: columns
::::::: {.column width="50%"}
### Enoch Powell, April 1968

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Conservative Shadow Cabinet: **“Rivers of Blood” speech**
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Topic: Immigration threat to British culture
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Polls and letters suggest broad popular sympathy with Powell’s message
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Political response: Isolated, forced to resign from shadow cabinet
:::
:::::::

::::::: {.column width="50%"}
### The consequence

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Powell’s 1968 speech sharply raised the salience of immigration.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
But, as Evans & Mellon argue, this did not crystallize into a new durable cleavage or party alignment in the 1970s–80s.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Thatcher selectively adopted “Powellite” themes in a more measured form, undercutting the electoral space for the National Front.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
NF/BNP links to neo-Nazism and post-war fascism made them less socially acceptable than many continental radical right parties, limiting their breakthrough potential.

## What happened next (1970s–2000s)?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
National Front (1967-): Peak **1.4% (1979)**

BNP (1982-): Peak **1.5% (2009)** + **2 MEPs**

#### The Puzzle
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Why did strong anti-immigration sentiment persist for 40+ years without a successful radical right party?
:::

## Same Demand, Divergent Party Trajectories

| Election | BNP Votes | BNP %    | UKIP Votes | UKIP %    |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **1997** | 35,832    | 1.4%     | 106,028    | 1.1%      |
| **2001** | 47,129    | 3.9%     | 380,575    | 2.2%      |
| **2005** | 192,746   | 4.3%     | 603,298    | 2.8%      |
| **2010** | 563,743   | **3.8%** | 919,546    | **3.5%**  |
| **2015** | 1,667     | **0.5%** | 3,881,129  | **13.2%** |

Indicators of underlying immigration/Europe scepticism change slowly, yet party fortunes diverge rapidly.
:::

## Three Questions

::: incremental
1.  **Supply-side failure (1968–2010):** Why did strong public demand not produce a breakthrough?
    -   Was it **extremism**? (NF/BNP too radical, organisationally weak)
    -   Was it **mainstream closure**? (Conservatives “stole the issue”)
    -   Or an **interaction of both**?
2.  **Supply-side success (2010–2016):** What changed to enable breakthrough?
    -   Which party finally succeeded, and why UKIP rather than BNP?
    -   Which **strategic choices** mattered (issue focus, leadership, moderation, organisation)?
3.  **The paradox: electoral marginality, policy victory**
    -   Just **1 seat** in Westminster
    -   Yet forced a **national referendum**
    -   Yet helped **reshape the country’s long‑term trajectory**
:::

# Part 2: Three Trajectories

## Why BNP Failed: Locked in Extremism

::: incremental
1.  **Geographic concentration**
    -   563,743 votes (2010) but only 3.8% nationally
    -   88 council seats (2005) on just 4.3% vote share
    -   Support heavily clustered in a few local strongholds
2.  **Extremism trap**
    -   Neo-Nazi imagery kept party on the hardline fringe
    -   Could hit 16% in local “true believer” areas
    -   But could never reach 4%+ nationally (repelled moderates)
3.  **Unable to moderate**
    -   Unlike UKIP, couldn’t soften message without losing core identity
    -   Fascist heritage blocked “respectable” rebranding
    -   Strategically stuck: need extremism to survive, but extremism blocks growth
:::

## Why UKIP Succeeded: Strategic Repositioning

::: incremental
1.  **Framing shift:**
    -   **BNP:** "British culture threatened by non-white immigrants" (racialist)
    -   **UKIP:** "Britain's sovereignty threatened by Brussels" (Eurosceptic)
2.  **Image matters:**
    -   **BNP:** Perceived Neo-Nazi associations, skinhead base, paramilitary
    -   **UKIP:** Farage in suits, professional media, mainstream
3.  **Anti-immigration reframed:**
    -   **BNP:** "Racial threat" (extremist appeal only)
    -   **UKIP:** "Public service pressure, population control" (moderate appeal)
4.  **Result:**
    -   Same underlying demand
    -   Completely different supply
    -   By 2015, access to roughly 6.8x more voters
:::

## The Paradox: 13.2% Votes, 1 Seat, Won Brexit

::: incremental
1.  **Electoral system effect**
    -   2014 EP (PR): 26.6% → 24 MEPs
    -   2015 GE (FPTP): 13.2% → 1 MP
    -   Same electorate, different rules → radically different representation
2.  **Electorally weak, but policy victory**
    -   Only 1 seat in Westminster
    -   Yet: Pushed Conservatives into promising a referendum (2013)
    -   Yet: Helped set the agenda for the 2016 Brexit vote
    -   → Electoral marginality ≠ policy irrelevance
3.  **Key insight**
    -   Non‑electoral pathways of influence: agenda‑setting, intra‑party pressure, media
    -   Far‑right success is not just about seats, but about shaping options
:::

## Why UKIP Declined, Why Reform Emerged (Same Demand, New Vessel)

::::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### UKIP 2010-2015 - Breakthrough and fulfilment
:::

-   Forced EU referendum onto agenda
-   Became main vehicle for Brexit demand
-   Policy goal achieved in 2016 → mission accomplished

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### UKIP 2016-2019 – Redundancy and collapse
:::

-   Core issue (EU membership) removed from agenda
-   Leadership crises and party infighting
-   Vote share and organisation rapidly disintegrate
:::::

::::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### Reform 2022-2024 – Successor party
:::

-   Farage returns with new vehicle (Clacton 2024)
-   Conservative government instability (Brexit fallout, Covid, Truss, etc.)
-   Rising Conservative voter dissatisfaction on immigration, taxes, “betrayed Brexit”
-   Same underlying demand (nationalist, anti‑establishment, anti‑immigration)
-   New credible supply to channel it

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### Pattern

-   Underlying demand is structural and durable
-   Party vehicles are temporary and recyclable (roughly every 15–20 years)
:::
:::::

## Reform Breaks into Scotland: Holyrood Constituency Vote

![Holyrood constituency vote intention, 2022-2026](images/constituency.png)

Source: Scottish Election Study, Scottish Opinion Monitor

**Question:** Why NOW? Scotland uses PR (not constrained by FPTP). This is pure demand/supply question.

::: notes
Same pattern in constituency vote: Reform absent → emerges → grows rapidly

Note: Both graphs show methodology change in Oct 2024 (when Reform formally added to options).

Before Oct 2024: Reform likely clustered in "Other"—so emergence is partly definitional (added as option) but also real (rapid growth once visible).

The answer comes next: Scotland's political space opens when the SNP-Tory symbiosis breaks and constitutional salience decays. This is supply-side theory playing out regionally.
:::

## Why Scotland's Political Space Opens Now (Vampa et al. Forthcoming in Political Studies)

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### 20 years (1998-2018): SNP-Tory symbiosis on constitutional issues
:::

-   SNP: "Vote for us for independence"

-   Conservatives: “Vote for us to defend the Union and deliver Brexit”

-   Independence vs. Union becomes the dominant cleavage, structuring party competition and voter alignments

-   Other conflicts (immigration, tax, anti‑establishment sentiment) are submerged beneath the sovereignty question
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### Post‑2019/2024: Symbiosis breaks down
:::

-   SNP weakened: leadership crisis, indyref fatigue, governing wear‑and‑tear

-   Scottish Conservatives lose credibility: UK‑wide scandals, Brexit delivery, and UK “muscular unionism” alienate voters

-   Salience of the constitutional issue stops rising and begins to diffuse into wider frustration with both camps
::::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### Result
:::

-   Constitutional polarisation erodes to let new player, like the anti‑establishment, anti‑SNP party enter the field (Reform) under proportional rules

## Demand is Structural, Supply is Contingent

::: incremental
1.  **Same demand, different supply vehicles:**
    -   2010: BNP (563k votes, extremist) vs UKIP (919k votes, sovereigntist)
    -   Underlying economic/cultural anxiety is similar
    -   Distinct framings → divergent electoral trajectories
2.  **Supply parties recycle (\~15-20 years):**
    -   BNP peaks mid‑2000s → hits extremism ceiling, collapses
    -   UKIP peaks 2015 → achieves Brexit goal, becomes redundant
    -   Reform rises post‑2022 → reactivates same reservoir of discontent
    -   Parties are disposable vessels; underlying demand is durable
3.  **Supply spreads to new regions:**
    -   England: BNP → UKIP → Reform as successive carriers
    -   Scotland: long blocked by constitutional salience → opening after SNP–Tory symbiosis breaks
    -   Same demand, different institutional and territorial opportunity structures

::: notes
**What we're looking at:**

This shows differences from reference categories across nine demographic dimensions:

**Reference baseline (0 line):** - Female (gender reference) - Age 18-34 (age reference) - Liberal on immigration (reference) - High trust in politicians (reference) - Political center (reference) - Comfortable income (reference) - High education (reference) - Urban location (reference) - Professional/managers (reference)

**Dennison & Goodwin framework predicts:** - Economic insecurity → lower education, working class (+) - Age → older voters (55-70) (+) - Cultural anxiety → restrictive immigration attitudes (+) - Political distrust → low trust in politicians (+) - Location → rural/small town (+)

**Is the data pattern as expected?**

Yes: Working class +, lower education +, restrictive immigration attitudes +, older voters +, rural +, low political trust +

This confirms: Multiple dimensions interact (economic + cultural + political).

::: notes
**The Real Paradox (not what the chart shows):**

The chart shows something MECHANICAL, not paradoxical: - FPTP suppresses representation → predictable, by design - PR enables proportional representation → also predictable, by design - This is HOW these systems work, not surprising

**The ACTUAL paradox is elsewhere:**

1.  **Electoral marginality via FPTP (2015):**
    -   3.88 million votes (12.6%) → 1 seat
    -   Massively unrepresented
2.  **But policy victory (2016):**
    -   Won Brexit referendum
    -   Forced government hand
    -   Achieved biggest political goal without parliament

**This contradicts an assumption:** - "Parliamentary seats = political power" - UKIP proves: Electoral marginality ≠ policy irrelevance - Non-electoral pathways (activism, public campaign, political pressure) can matter more than seats

**This is genuinely puzzling:** - How do parties without seats win referendums? - How do marginal parties force major policy shifts? - What does this tell us about far-right influence beyond parliament?

This will be crucial for Week 9 (normalization): Far-right influence operates through multiple channels, not just electoral representation.

## From Strategy to System: What the UK Case Shows

-   Same grievances, different party framings and images → different voter coalitions.

-   Same voters, different electoral rules → different representation in office.

-   Weak in parliament, but strong through referendums and discourse → major policy change (Brexit).

**Key questions**:
:::

1)  Which party strategies unlock broad support among those worried about immigration and Europe?

2)  How do electoral rules and referendums channel that support into real policy outcomes?
