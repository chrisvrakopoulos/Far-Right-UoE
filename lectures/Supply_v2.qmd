# Part 1: Recap – The Limits of Demand

## Beyond Latent Demand

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
**Demand-side (Week 7)**

::: incremental
-   Grievances (Economic, Cultural, Status)
-   Stable anti-immigrant potential (\~40–60%)
-   **Individual-level** readiness to vote far-right
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
**Supply-side (Week 8)**

::: incremental
-   **Context (Structure):** Electoral rules, party competition, media salience
-   **Party (Agency):** Credible organization, leadership, strategic framing
:::
::::
:::::::

. . .

**Theoretical Reality:** Grievances can remain "latent" for decades without political representation (e.g., Germany 1990-2013).

## The Core Puzzle: Demand without Supply?

::: incremental
-   **UK (1990s-2010s):** High Euroskepticism and Nativism → **0 MPs** due to FPTP system.
-   **Spain (2008-2018):** Severe Economic Crisis → **No Far Right breakthrough** until 2018.
-   **Germany (1980s-2013):** High Authoritarian Potential → **Blocked** by historical stigma and failed parties.
-   **Scandinavia:** Similar levels of cultural threat → **Varied Breakthrough Timing** (Denmark 1990s vs Sweden 2010).
:::

. . .

→ Demand is a **necessary condition**, but Supply is the **sufficient condition**.

# Part 2: The Theoretical Pivot

## From Normal Pathology to Pathological Normalcy

::: incremental
-   **Old View (Scheuch & Klingemann 1967):** Far right as an "abnormal" pathology of extreme crisis.
    -   *Logic:* Crisis → Far Right. No Crisis → No Far Right.
-   **New View (Mudde 2010): "Pathological Normalcy"**
    -   Far-right values (Nativism, Authoritarianism) are **radicalised versions of mainstream values**.
    -   These values are always present in the electorate.
-   **The Supply-Side Shift:**
    -   Variation is explained by **political opportunity structures** and **party agency**, not the emergence of "new" grievances.
:::

# Part 3: External Supply (Structure)

## Political Opportunity Structures (POS)

**1. Institutional Factors (The Rules of the Game)**

::: incremental
-   **Electoral Systems:**
    -   **Proportional Representation (PR):** Low entry barriers (e.g., Netherlands) → Easy entry.
    -   **Majoritarian Systems:** High barriers (e.g., UK) → "Wasted vote" logic suppresses supply.
-   **State Funding & Media Access:**
    -   Institutional support helps stabilize new parties (e.g., Germany, Belgium).
:::

## 2. Spatial Competition & The Vacant Flank

**Kitschelt (1995):** Mainstream convergence creates opportunities.

**The "Convergence" Mechanism:**

-   When Left and Right become indistinguishable on economics/EU.

-   The **Authoritarian-Right** flank is left open.

-   **Result:** Far Right becomes the "only alternative" for voters seeking cultural protection.
:::
:::::

## 3. Mainstream Strategies (Meguid 2005)

Mainstream parties control the **issue salience**.

| Strategy | Action | Outcome for Niche Party |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Dismissal** | Ignore the issue | **Hurts** (if issue remains non-salient). |
| **Accommodation** | Adopt their position | **Hurts** (if *Proximal* party does it → Theft).<br>**Helps** (if *Distal* party does it → Legitimises). |
| **Adversarial** | Attack the position | **Helps** (Increases visibility & salience). |

. . .

$\rightarrow$ **The Danger:** Engaging (even attacking) gives the "Oxygen" of publicity.

# Part 4: Discursive Supply (Structure)

## Discursive Opportunity Structures (DOS)

It is not just about rules, but about **Public Visibility**. **Koopmans & Olzak (2004):**

::: incremental
1.  **Visibility:** Does the media prioritize the party's issues? (e.g., immigration).
2.  **Resonance:** Does the party's frame "make sense" given everyday reality?
3.  **Legitimacy:** Is the actor treated as a valid participant in debate?
:::

. . .

::: fragment
**Issue Ownership & Salience:** - Far-right parties "own" immigration.

-   **Breakthroughs** happen when external shocks (e.g., 2015 Refugee Crisis) spike issue salience.
:::

# Part 5: Internal Supply (Agency)

## Agency: The "Winning Formula"

Far-right parties must choose a strategic profile to maximize votes.

**Evolution of the Formula (Kitschelt 1995; De Lange 2007):**

| Dimension | **The 1990s Strategy** | **The Modern Strategy** |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Cultural (The Core)** | **Hyper-Conservative** (Nativist/Authoritarian) | **Hyper-Conservative** (Nativist/Authoritarian) |
| **Economic (The Variable)** | **Neoliberal** (Anti-Tax, Small State) | **Centrist / Left-Leaning** (Welfare Chauvinist) |
| **Target Voter** | Small business / Petty Bourgeoisie | **Working Class** / Precariat |
| **Master Case** | Early FN (FR), Early FPÖ (AT) | RN (FR), SD (SE), Finns (FI) |

## The Economic Shift: Centrist Move via Welfare Chauvinism

::: incremental
-   **Strategic Repositioning:** To expand beyond their "petty bourgeois" base, parties moved toward the **economic center/left**.
-   **The Mechanism:** Welfare is not presented as "redistribution" (Left) but as a **National Asset**.
-   **Broadened Appeal:** By defending the welfare state (for citizens only), they neutralize the traditional advantage of Social Democratic parties.
-   **The Paradox:** They are "Centrist" on economics to better sell "Hyper-Conservative" cultural policies.
:::

## Welfare Chauvinism as Strategic Innovation

> "Danish welfare for the Danes." — DPP Slogan

::: incremental
-   **The Innovation:** Reframing the welfare state as a **national patrimony** rather than a socialist project.
-   **Strategic Benefit:** Allows the Far Right to attract traditional Left voters while maintaining a radical cultural profile.
-   **Diffusion:** This model was pioneered in Scandinavia and has now spread across Western Europe.
:::

## Models of Organisation (Art 2011)

Stability is determined by the **Internal Agency** of the party.

| Feature | **Institutionalised Party** (RN, SD, FPÖ) | **Entrepreneurial Party** (PVV, LPF, Reform UK) |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Structure** | Branches, Members, Congresses | Leader-owned, Top-down, Low membership |
| **Stability** | **High** (survives leadership changes) | **Fragile** (volatility/collapse risks) |
| **Mobilisation** | Local networks / Ground game | Media-driven / "Air war" |
| **Survival** | Persists through setbacks | Often "Flash" success followed by collapse |

. . .

$\rightarrow$ **Institutionalisation** is the single best predictor of whether a party survives its first election.

## The "Detoxification" Strategy

**The Moderation Dilemma:** How to grow without losing the core?

```

-   **Marine Le Pen's Strategy:** Purging extremists and rebranding while maintaining the nativist core.
-   **The Goal:** Moving from a "protest party" to a "government-in-waiting."

# Part 6: Synthesis

## Solving the Puzzles: Structure + Agency {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}

| Case | The Puzzle | The Supply-Side Explanation |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **UK** | High Demand, No Seats | **Electoral Rules:** FPTP blocked representation despite high Euroskepticism. |
| **Spain** | Crisis but no Far Right | **Agency/Timing:** No credible party until Vox framed the **Catalan Crisis** as a threat to national unity. |
| **Germany** | 30-Year Delay | **Stigma & Entry:** Stigma blocked the extreme right; AfD entered as "respectable" before radicalising. |
| **Netherlands** | High Volatility | **Organisation:** Dominance of **Entrepreneurial** (leader-centric) parties like LPF and PVV. |
| **Scandinavia** | Welfare State Support | **Innovation:** Early and successful adoption of the **Welfare Chauvinist** winning formula. |

## The Non-Inevitability of Success

Far-right breakthroughs are **not** structurally guaranteed. Success can be halted by:

::: incremental
-   **Strategic Containment:** When mainstream right parties successfully absorb far-right factions (e.g., Spain's PP before 2013).
-   **Supply Implosion:** Incompetence or scandal destroying the vehicle (e.g., **BNP** in UK, **Republicans** in Germany).
-   **The "Government Curse":** Moderation in office leading to collapse (e.g., **LAOS** in Greece, **Blue Reform** in Finland).
-   **Institutional Stigma:** Strong civic education or judicial intervention (e.g., Golden Dawn).
:::

# Conclusions

## Summary & Open Questions

::: incremental
1.  **Demand creates potential**, but Supply determines its **political reality**.
2.  **No Single Recipe:** Different regions require different supply-side adaptations (e.g., Welfare Chauvinism in the North vs. Sovereignty/National Unity in the South).
3.  **The Interaction:** Supply factors (Rules, Strategy, Organisation) explain why similar demand profiles produce wildly different outcomes.
4.  **Is Normalisation inevitable?** If the Far Right adopts the "Modern Formula," can mainstream parties ever push them back?
