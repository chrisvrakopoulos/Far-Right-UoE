## The Core Puzzle

::: incremental
-   **The Observation:** Across Europe, Mainstream Parties (MSPs) have tried everything to stop the Far-Right.
-   **The Strategies:** They have ignored them, attacked them, and copied them.
-   **The Outcome:** The Far-Right has moved from the "lunatic fringe" to the centre of power.
-   **The Question:** Why do "rational" strategies by powerful mainstream parties fail to stop—and often accelerate—this process?
:::

## Analytical Framework

::: incremental
-   We will examine three core dimensions of the normalization process.
-   **Dimension I: Strategic Competition** (The Rational Actor vs. Empirical Reality)
-   **Dimension II: Information Environments** (The Role of Media in Shaping Preferences)
-   **Dimension III: Temporal Dynamics** (Stigmatization and Path Dependence)
:::

# Dimension I: Strategic Competition

## Theory A: The Spatial Logic (Meguid 2005, 2008)

::: incremental
-   **Premise:** Politics is a market. Parties compete for voters on issues.
-   **The Problem:** A niche party (Far-Right) owns a new issue (Immigration).
-   **The Solution (Accommodation):** The Mainstream Centre-Right (MCR) should **adopt** the niche party's position.
-   **The Mechanism:**
    1.  MCR steals "ownership" of the issue.
    2.  Voters, seeing identical policies, choose the large, competent MCR over the risky niche party.
    3.  **Result:** Niche party collapses.
:::

## The Empirical Reality Check (Krause et al. 2023)

::: incremental
-   **The Test:** Analyzed 350+ mainstream strategies across 12 Western European countries (1976-2017).
-   **The Question:** Does adopting anti-immigration positions reduce Far-Right votes?
-   **The Finding:** **No.**
    -   Accommodation does *not* reduce Radical Right support.
    -   In fact, it often **increases** voter transfers *to* the Radical Right.
-   **The Mechanism:** Voters prefer the "original" to the "copy" (Jean-Marie Le Pen).
-   **Key Takeaway:** You cannot beat the Far-Right by becoming them.
:::

## Does it work? The Case of the UK

::: incremental
-   **Scenario:** UKIP threatens the Conservative Party (2010s).
-   **Strategy:** Conservatives adopt UKIP's core demand (EU Referendum/Brexit).
-   **Electoral Outcome:** UKIP vote collapses (2017/2019).
-   **Verdict:** Meguid appears right *only* if we look at the party label.
-   **BUT:** As Krause et al. suggest, this is the exception, not the rule. And the ideological cost was total.
:::

## Theory B: The Legitimacy Trap (Daur 2024)

::: incremental
-   **The Counter-Argument:** Accommodating a "Pariah" (outcast) party isn't just a policy shift; it's a moral signal.
-   **The Experiment:** Daur (2024) shows that when MSPs adopt Far-Right positions or cooperate, they signal that the Far-Right is **"appropriate, proper, and just."**
-   **The "Validation" Effect:**
    -   Voters update their beliefs: "If the Prime Minister says it, it can't be racist."
    -   Legitimacy extends beyond the MSP's own voters.
:::

## Synthesis: The "Success" Paradox

::: incremental
-   **The Double Failure:**
    1.  **Electoral:** You often fail to destroy the party. Krause et al. (2023) show accommodation often *helps* the Far-Right.
    2.  **Normative:** Even if the party dies (e.g., UKIP), you normalise the **ideology** (Brexit is law).
-   **The Trap:** By accommodating, you lower the "reputational cost" of Far-Right ideas.
-   **Valentim (2021):** This is amplified by **Representation**.
    -   Crossing the threshold (5%) into Parliament acts as an institutional "Seal of Approval."
    -   Radical views become publicly acceptable *because* they are present in the House.
:::

# Dimension II: Information Environments

## Theory A: The "Mirror" Hypothesis

::: incremental
-   **Premise:** Media and parties just "reflect" what the people want (Demand-Side).
-   **Argument:** The Far-Right rises because people are *already* worried about immigration. The media just reports it.
-   **Implication:** Censoring the Far-Right or the media wouldn't change the underlying demand.
:::

## Theory B: The Media as "Maker" (Foos & Bischof 2022)

::: incremental
-   **The Study:** A natural experiment in the UK.
-   **The Event:** The Liverpool boycott of *The Sun* (tabloid) after the Hillsborough disaster (1989).
-   **The Findings:**
    -   Merseyside (boycott area) became significantly **less Eurosceptic** than comparable areas.
    -   Why? Because they weren't exposed to decades of anti-EU crusade by *The Sun*.
-   **The Implication:** The media doesn't just mirror demand; it **manufactures** it.
:::

## Connect to Normalisation

::: incremental
-   If media campaigns can drive Euroscepticism (as Foos & Bischof show), what happens when mainstream media treats the Far-Right as "normal"?
-   **Media Mainstreaming:**
    -   Giving them a platform (BBC "Question Time" effect).
    -   Adopting their frames ("Mass Migration" vs. "Refugee Crisis").
-   **Conclusion:** Normalisation happens *before* the vote is even cast, in the pages of the tabloids.
:::

# Dimension III: Temporal Dynamics

## Theory A: The "Thermostat" (Re-Stigmatisation)

::: incremental
-   **Premise:** If accommodation fails, MSPs can just switch back to **Isolation** (Cordon Sanitaire).
-   **Logic:** "We tried talking to them, it didn't work, now we will ostracise them again."
-   **Assumption:** Stigma is a switch you can turn on and off.
:::

## Theory B: The "One-Way Street" (Balcells et al. 2025)

::: incremental
-   **The Experiment:** Can you re-stigmatise a party (like Vox in Spain) after it has been normalised?
-   **The Finding:** **No.**
-   Once the taboo is broken, attempts to re-impose stigma fail or backfire.
-   **Why?**
    -   Voters have already seen the party as a legitimate partner.
    -   Calling them "undemocratic" now sounds like a strategic lie, not a moral truth.
:::

## The "Stimulus" Effect (Ammassari 2024)

::: incremental
-   **Pre-Normalisation:** Stigma works. It scares off moderate voters (Social Desirability Bias).
-   **Post-Normalisation:** Stigma fails.
    -   For core supporters, attacks from the mainstream act as a **stimulus**.
    -   "They hate us because we tell the truth."
-   **The Result:** The "Cordon Sanitaire" only works if you never break it. Once broken, it cannot be repaired.
:::

# Synthesis & Seminar Prep

## The Grand Puzzle for Discussion

::: incremental
-   **The Rational Trap:**
    -   If you ignore them → Media might amplify them (Foos & Bischof).
    -   If you accommodate them → You legitimise their ideas (Daur) and often lose votes (Krause et al.).
    -   If you attack them → You might stimulate their base (Ammassari).
-   **Discussion Q1:** Is there *any* successful strategy for a Mainstream Party today?
-   **Discussion Q2:** Look at your case study. Did the "Cordon Sanitaire" break? If so, did it follow the "One-Way Street" logic?
:::

## Key Takeaways

::: incremental
1.  **Meguid's Model is flawed:** Empirical evidence shows accommodation rarely works (Krause et al.) and ignores normative legitimacy.
2.  **Media matters:** It shapes the battlefield before the battle begins (Foos & Bischof).
3.  **Irreversibility:** Normalisation is a ratchet mechanism. It creates a new baseline for what is "acceptable" in democracy.
