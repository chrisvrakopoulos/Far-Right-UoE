### Seminar

#### In-Class Activities

You will be assigned to one region just for this week: Western Europe, UK-Ireland, Scandinavia, Southern Europe, or Eastern Europe.

Explore the interactive graph from the lecture slides for your region and identify what patterns you notice. When did far-right support rise? Which countries led and which lagged? What are the key differences in trajectories across your region?

Write down the pattern you observed in the data, propose an explanation for it (consider economic factors, immigration/cultural change, political failures, historical legacies, welfare state dynamics, or other factors), and explain your reasoning for why you think this explanation fits.

Then consider the bigger picture: what explains the variation between regions? Why does Scandinavia's pattern differ from Southern Europe's, or Eastern Europe from Western Europe? Record your cross-regional explanation on the Whiteboard.

#### What's Next

Your hypotheses will be documented and tested against actual country evidence in Weeks 2-6, then revisited and refined in theory seminars (Weeks 7-10).
